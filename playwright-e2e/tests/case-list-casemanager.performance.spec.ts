/* Because lighthouse has to use a new page to run its tests
 * the new page has to be passed to the test via a fixture (lighthousePage)
 * a caveat of this is that all performance tests must be tagged with @performance
 * also important to note lighthouse is only supported in chromium based browsers
 *
 * to enable parallelisation, the port must also be passed via a worker-scoped fixture (lighthousePort)
 *
 * lighthouseUtils provides the utils class which contains the common audit method
